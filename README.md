## Mission Statement

Our simple Java calculator is designed to help novice developers learn how to create a calculator program with Java. Our easy-to-use code and intuitive user interface make it accessible and approachable for people of all skill levels. With the use of a large subset of tools in Java and the use of Java Swing, we aim to teach users about both the back end process and a little bit about the front end process of software development and give them a solid foundation for building more complex projects in the future.

If you use the executable "SimpleJavaCalculator.jar" file and that doesn't work, you can type this in your terminal:

```shell
java -jar /your_calculator_directory/SimpleJavaCalculator.jar`

### COMP 312 Project Modifications, Improvements and Contributions
- Abilty to show Text Panel on Mac (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Button Placements (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Button Super-Scripts (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Inverse Trigonometric functions (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Decimal functionality (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Theme implementation (light, dark) (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Undefined Feature with division (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Ability to Run Application on Mac (Jesus Cantu)
- Pi and Euler‚Äôs number buttons (Jesus Cantu)
- Software quality metrics displayed through GitHub Badges (sources: Codacy, CodeClimate, CodeCove, Travis CI) (Jesus Cantu)
- Addition and implementation of advanced trigonometric functions (Ibrahim Ben Hadj Tahar)
- Factorials, Permutations and Combinations (Roshan Ali)

- **Here are some potential ideas that were considered but not implemented due to time constraints:**
- Degree-Radian toggle button: A button to switch between degree and radian mode for trigonometric functions, allowing users to work with angles in their preferred unit.
- Keyboard input support: Enable users to perform calculations using their keyboard, improving the user experience and efficiency
- Customizable button layout: Allow users to rearrange and customize the button layout to suit their preferences and usage patterns
- Responsive design: Optimize the calculator's user interface for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent experience across different platforms

## How to Use New Features
- For any trig identity simply type in a value and press the specific trig identity button
  - Ex: 2tan
- For the pi button you can use pi by itself by just pressing the button or by doing an operation with another number such as (30 * pi =)
  - Note that you cannot press pi and then a number. You must press pi then an operation then a number
- For Combinations and Permuations you have to press a number then press the desired funciton and then another button followed by the equals button
  - Ex: 12 nCr 6 =
- For factorials and Euler's number, you must first press a number and then press the factorial or Euler button
  - Ex: 6n! / 6e
- To change Theme press the drop down menu at the top to switch from dark to light
