### COMP 312 Project Modifications, Improvements and Contributions
- Abilty to show Text Panel on Mac (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Button Placements (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Button Super-Scripts (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Inverse Trigonometric functions (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Decimal functionality (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Theme implementation (light, dark) (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Undefined Feature with division (Jonathan Drysdale-Anderson)
- Ability to Run Application on Mac (Jesus Cantu)
- Pi and Euler‚Äôs number buttons (Jesus Cantu)
- Software quality metrics displayed through GitHub Badges (sources: Codacy, CodeClimate, CodeCove, Travis CI) (Jesus Cantu)
- Cot, Csc buttons (Ibrahim Ben Hadj Tahar)
- Factorials, Permutations and Combinations (Roshan Ali)
- **We contemplated doing a button that switches between degrees and radians but ran out of time to implement it properly**

## How to Use New Features
- For any trig identity simply type in a value and press the specific trig identity button
- For the pi button you can use pi by itself by just pressing the button or by doing an operation with another number such as (30*pi)
  - Note that you cannot press pi and then a number. You must press pi then an operation then a number
- For Combinations and Permuations you have to press a number then press the desired funciton and then another button followed by the equals button
- For factorials, you must first press a number and then press the factorial button
- To change Theme press the drop down menu at the top to switch from dark to light
